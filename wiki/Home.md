### Introduction
**Peppy** is the audio player which contains three components: [Hardware](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Hardware), [Software](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Software) and [Woodware](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Woodware).

Why Peppy? This is the first word which came to my mind when I tried to find out any word which would contain three **P** characters for **P**ython **P**ygame **P**layer. That reflects the fact that the software component was written in Python language using Pygame library.

Here are the key features of the [Hardware](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Hardware) component:
* It is based on popular single-board computer [Raspberry Pi 2](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Raspberry Pi 2).
* High quality audio achieved by using integrated Amplifier module [HiFiBerry Amp+](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Amplifier) and [Sony speakers](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Speakers).
* The [Hardware](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Hardware) has six "senses" to control its functionality:
    * [Mouse](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Other Control Devices#mouse)
    * [Keyboard](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Other Control Devices#keyboard)
    * [Touchscreen](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Touchscreen)
    * [Infrared Remote Control](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Infrared Sensor)
    * [Rotary Encoders](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Rotary Encoders)
    * Any computer in a local network or mobile device with [Web Browser](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Web UI)

Here are the key features of the [Software](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Software) component:
* This is application written in Python.
* Peppy provides Graphical User Interface for audio players running in a headless mode. Currently Peppy supports 'Mpd' audio player.
* Embedded Web Server allows to control audio playback from any [Web Browser](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Web UI).
* The default touchscreen resolution is 480*320. This is the resolution of the TFT used for this project. Though UI is dynamic and can scale to any screen [resolution](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Resolution).
* Currently Peppy has only Internet Radio functionality. In the future releases support for playing audio files and streams will be implemented as well.
* By default Peppy has [playlists](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Playlists) containing free radio stations for English, French, German and Russian languages. Users can add their own stations to the playlists.

The key features of the [Woodware](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Woodware) component include:
* Original custom [design](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Design).
* Made of solid [wood (Cherry and Walnut)](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Woodware#materials).
* Natural [finish](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Finishing) - the variation of [French polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_polish).

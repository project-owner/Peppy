[Raspberri Pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is a single-board computer. It was developed for educational purposes. But due to its small form factor and extensibility it became very popular platform for DIY (Do-It-Yourself) projects including audio projects. The functionality of the Raspberry Pi 2 can be extended by adding so-called HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) modules which can be connected to 40-pin GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) connector. You can see it on the far side of the module in the following image.

Raspberry Pi 2 is ready to use right out of the box. The only thing which you need to provide is a Micro SD (Secure Digital) flash memory card with OS (Operating System) image. [Raspbian](https://www.raspbian.org/) (Debian for Raspberry Pi) is probably the most popular OS based on Debian Linux flavor and optimized for Raspberry Pi platform. You can [buy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T2U7R7I) Raspberry Pi 2, download OS image and write it to your own Micro SD flash card using free program [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/). 

Also you can [buy](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A5R8GQW) Raspberry Pi bundled with flash card where OS will be installed already. For Peppy player I installed OS on my own Micro SD card. The details will be explained in the corresponding [chapter](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Raspbian). After preparing SD card you just need to insert it into the slot on the bottom of the Raspberry Pi and you are ready to go.

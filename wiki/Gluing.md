The gluing process usually requires just two things: wood glue and clamps. It's not recommended to install clamps directly on the pieces which your are gluing. That's because clamps can leave dents. And probably the only way to get rid of those dents is to sand the whole surface down until dents disappear.

To avoid dents from clamps it's recommended to use some spare boards and insert them between clamps and wood. Even in this case don't over-tighten the clamps as you can get dents from insertion boards instead. A modern wood glue makes so strong binding that there is no need to tighten pieces too much. 

To avoid gluing your insertion boards to the main pieces you can wrap those insertion boards into clear sealing/packaging tape. During the gluing process some excess glue can come out from the connection points. Just wipe it out with paper towel. Don't worry if you will see hardened glue on your piece. It will be easily removed during the [sanding](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Sanding) process.

Wood glue starts hardening pretty quickly. Therefore you should work fast. Plan your gluing process in advance. Make so-called dry-fit by attaching all wood pieces and clamps together but without glue. That helps to see what is missing to complete the process. 

Usually wood glue hardens in one hour but it's recommended to leave it harden for one day. After that you can start [sanding](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Sanding) process.

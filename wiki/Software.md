The details about installation and configuration of each software component will be discussed in the corresponding chapters.

###Software Tools###
Here are the main Software Tools which were used for Peppy player development:

1. **[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/)**. This is popular IDE for Software Development.

2. **[PyDev](http://www.pydev.org/)**. This is Python plugin for Eclipse.

3. **[PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html)**. This software was used to connect to the [Raspberry Pi 2](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Raspberry Pi 2) through SSH.

4. **[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)**. This program was necessary to copy files from Windows machine to [Raspberry Pi 2](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Raspberry Pi 2).

5. **[Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)**. The [Raspbian](https://github.com/project-owner/Peppy/wiki/Raspbian) OS image was placed to SD card using this program.

The finishing process of the Peppy wooden case contained two steps:

1. **Applying Linseed Oil**. This step is necessary to enhance the natural wood color. 
2. **Applying Shellac**. This final step closes wood pores and makes the surface glossy.

### Applying Linseed Oil.
The linseed oil should be applied on the whole surface of the wooden case - inside and outside. The whole piece should be covered at once. Let the wood soak oil as much as it needs. The oil dries in minutes. I applied oil 3-4 times. As walnut is open grained wood it absorbs more oil than closed grain cherry. In the end you can wipe out excess oil by paper towels. Let it sit and dry for a week or two. There is some gassing going on while the dryers in the oil do their work. The following image shows the case after oiling process.

### Applying Shellac
The last finishing step is the variation of the famous [French polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_polish) method which was used by European furniture makers for centuries. This is a bit tedious process but gives very good result. The main idea is to apply multiple shellac coats during a week period. Shellac which I bought is too thick to use it right out of the can. Therefore I diluted shellac with alcohol using ratio - 1 part shellac and 2 parts alcohol. More alcohol makes drying faster.

Shellac should be also applied on the whole surface - inside and outside. Each day I applied 2-3 coats. Then let it dry and next day using 320 grit sanding paper rubbed lightly the whole surface to flatten it. Don't rub through the whole shellac layer. Actually shellac doesn't layer. The new coat melts into the previous one. After sanding I removed the white shellac powder with a soft fabric. Repeat the process during one week.

In a week I got very nice smooth flat glass surface. Shellac doesn't block UV rays. As I did that on open air with sun rays hitting the case the cherry wood became darker than it was originally coming closer to the walnut. But don't expose the piece to the open sun for a long time as the shellac and oil can literally boil and it will be difficult to get rid of those small air bubbles in your finish.
